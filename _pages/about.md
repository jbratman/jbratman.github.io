Hi, I’m Jeff — an Aerospace Engineering graduate from UC San Diego with a passion for building systems that move, fly, and think for themselves.

I thrive at the intersection of mechanical design, controls, and hands-on prototyping. Over the past few years, I’ve taken ideas from concept sketches and CAD models all the way to track, tunnel, and flight tests.

- At UCSD, I co-led the design and flight testing of a payload-delivery aircraft, where I not only engineered the gear-driven four-bar linkage system but also helped with the hands-on manufacturing of structural parts and integration of servos, linkages, and electronics.

- As Mechanical Lead for Triton AI’s autonomous race kart, I designed and tested subsystems that pushed the boundaries of student racing autonomy — work that connected directly to simulation, telemetry validation, and the Indy Autonomous Challenge.

- I also designed and built an autonomous racecar demo for OpenSauce 2025, giving show attendees a hands-on experience with self-driving racing technology. This project highlighted not only my technical design skills but also my ability to communicate engineering to a broader audience.

My journey started in the automotive world, where I learned that manufacturability and serviceability matter as much as performance. That perspective continues to shape my work today — whether it’s machining aircraft components, wiring embedded systems, or optimizing CAD for rapid prototyping.

I’m always looking for opportunities to collaborate on projects that merge aerospace, robotics, and autonomy — turning ambitious ideas into systems you can actually build, test, and push to the limit. Feel free to check out my work or reach out!
