## Overview
This project focused on developing modular sensor mounts and integration of body shell for a 1/10th-scale autonomous racecar.  
The system was designed to be adaptable across vehicle setups while reducing downtime during testing.

## Features
- Designed modular CAD + 3D-printed sensor mounts
- Improved serviceability and reduced downtime during races

## Design Constraints
- Utilize current sensor package on vehicle
- Integrate secondary Livox Mid 360 lidar into front area of vehicle
- Change appearance from robot to autonomous vehicle
- Maintain strength and endurance from impacts
- Improve serviceability
